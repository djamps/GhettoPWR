# GhettoPWR
MCU code for power supply/BMS board designed specifically for powering GhettoDSP and amplifiers, but can be used with any other bluetooth speaker project.  Provides power switching (momentary power button), power status (power LED blink/fade codes), boost power for amplifier module(s) (up to 400 watts), and 5V buck for the DSP or accesories.  

It also provides optional charging control and BMS functions for 4-8 cell lithium battery banks.

Optional communication with GhettoDSP board via I2C for LCD display of voltages and status.
